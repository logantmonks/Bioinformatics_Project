#PARTONE
#In order to accomplish this project, the objectives in mind are to isolate the methane producing organisms along with the ones that are pH resistant
#In order to begin, the first step was to establish the hmmsearch, hmmbuild, and muscle into their own working directories. I also placed the proteome and reference sequences in their own directories too.

#PARTTWO
#I want to find each proteome by creating a hmm profile and seperate the mcrA and hsp genes 
#The previous step is going to help me isloate the methane producing genes and the pH tolerance genes
#To make things easier, I went ahead and made a new file directory system and added the mcrA genes into each of their respected locations
#Using muscle will help align the sequences with their respective proteomes
./muscle3.8.31_i86linux64 -in $1 -out $1_figureone
./muscle3.8.31_i86linux64 -in $2 -out $2_figuretwo

#The hmmbuild is the attempt to pull the desired reference gene
./hmmbuild $1_build $1_figureone
./hmmbuild $2_build $2_figuretwo

#Then I wanted to run a for loop and a series of pipeline in order to organize the mcrA and hsp70 genes for each proteome
